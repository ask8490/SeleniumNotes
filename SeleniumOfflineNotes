Selenium Notes

#1. To Launch the browser:
	System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","path of chromedriver.exe");
	WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 
	
#2. to launch a webpage:
	driver.get("Fully qualified URL");
	driver.navigateTo("fully Qualified URL")
	
#3. to navigate forward back & refresh:
	driver.navigate().forward();
	driver.navigate().back();
	driver.navigate().refresh();
	
#4: To get a screenshot of the webpage:
	to get the screenshot of the webpage we need to typecast driver object to TakeScreenshot Interface. and use method getScreenshotAs()
	
	File source = ((TakeScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs("OutputType.FILE");
	Return type of getScreenshotAs method is a file, This file will store the screenshot in temp memory of the machine.
	
	To get the file on our desired location, we need to create File class object by providing path to new location where we wish to store the screenshot
	File destination = new File("path to destination folder including file name and file extension(png/jpg)");
	
	Now by using copy() method of FileHandler class, we can copy screenshot file to destination folder.
